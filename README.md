Conversion of the [Figma design](https://figmashort.link/bREHpN) into code using React.js


##Example: 
Purchase Price = 50
Sale Price = 100
Expenses = 20
Investment Type = Long Term
Annual Income = ($45001 - $120000).

For the above inputs, calculation would be:
Tax Rate = “$5092 + 32.5% of excess over $45000”
Capital Gains Amount = 30
Long Term Capital Gains Discount = 15
Net Capital Gains Amount = 15
Tax you need to pay = 4.875 (which is 32.5% of 15)
