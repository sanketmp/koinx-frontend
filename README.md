Conversion of the [Figma design](https://figmashort.link/bREHpN) into code using React.js


## Example: 

Purchase Price = 50<br>
Sale Price = 100<br>
Expenses = 20<br>
Investment Type = Long Term<br>
Annual Income = ($45001 - $120000).<br>

For the above inputs, calculation would be:<br>
Tax Rate = “$5092 + 32.5% of excess over $45000”<br>
Capital Gains Amount = 30<br>
Long Term Capital Gains Discount = 15<br>
Net Capital Gains Amount = 15<br>
Tax you need to pay = 4.875 (which is 32.5% of 15)
